## Changes

### 2025-05-15: Fixed Critical Bug in Volatile Storage Message Retrieval

Fixed a bug in the chat message retrieval system where messages stored in volatile memory weren't being properly returned to clients.

**Key Changes:**
- Modified `VolatileCopilotChatMessageContext.QueryEntitiesAsync` to immediately materialize query results
- Replaced `Task.Run` with `Task.FromResult` to prevent async threading issues
- Added diagnostic logging to track message retrieval pipeline

**Implementation Details:**
- The original implementation used LINQ with deferred execution, causing potential race conditions
- When the query was defined and when it was actually executed, the state of the collection could change
- Fixed by using `.ToList()` to immediately materialize each step of the LINQ query
- Ensures that the filtering, ordering, and pagination operations execute immediately
- Replaced asynchronous `Task.Run` with synchronous `Task.FromResult` to maintain execution context

**Benefits:**
- Fixed empty results being returned even when messages existed in the repository
- Improved reliability of in-memory storage for development/testing
- Added comprehensive logging for message retrieval debugging
- Eliminated potential race conditions in async message handling

## Changes

## Changes

### 2025-05-02: API Request Format Documentation for Chat Messages

Added documentation for the required request format when posting messages to the chat endpoint.

**Key Details:**
- The POST endpoint for chat messages (`/chats/{chatId}/messages`) requires a `messageType` parameter.
- This parameter must be provided as a key-value pair in the `variables` array of the request body.
- Valid messageType values are "Message" (standard chat), "Plan", or "Document" (for uploaded documents).

**Correct Request Format:**
```json
{
  "input": "Your message text here",
  "variables": [
    {
      "key": "messageType",
      "value": "Message"
    }
  ],
  "contextId": "default"
}
```

**Implementation Details:**
- The `ChatPlugin.ChatAsync` method requires a `messageType` parameter that is passed from the variables collection.
- This value determines how the message is processed and stored in the chat history.
- Failure to include the messageType results in a "Missing argument for function parameter 'messageType'" error.

## Changes

### 2025-03-28: HTTP-only Configuration with SignalR Optimization

Configured the webapi to use HTTP-only communication and optimized SignalR for in-cluster communication.

**Key Changes:**
- Removed HTTPS requirements to support cluster-internal communication
- Configured CORS to allow any origin during development
- Enhanced SignalR settings for optimal WebSocket performance
- Updated Docker configuration to remove HTTPS dependencies

**Implementation Details:**
- Changed Kestrel configuration to use HTTP on port 8080 with binding to all interfaces:
  ```json
  "Kestrel": {
    "Endpoints": {
      "Http": {
        "Url": "http://0.0.0.0:8080"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- Updated CORS service configuration to properly handle wildcard origin:
  ```csharp
  if (allowedOrigins.Length == 1 && allowedOrigins[0] == "*")
  {
      // Allow any origin
      policy.AllowAnyOrigin()
          .WithMethods("POST", "GET", "PUT", "DELETE", "PATCH")
          .AllowAnyHeader();
  }
  ```
- Optimized SignalR for HTTP WebSockets:
  ```csharp
  builder.Services.AddSignalR(options =>
  {
      options.EnableDetailedErrors = true;
      options.KeepAliveInterval = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1);
      options.MaximumReceiveMessageSize = 1024 * 1024; // 1MB
  });
  ```
- Removed HTTPS certificate handling from Docker build

**Benefits:**
- Simplified deployment in Kubernetes or Docker environments
- Eliminated need for HTTPS certificates in development/testing
- Improved real-time communication performance
- Allowed any frontend service to connect during development
- Reduced configuration complexity for in-cluster communication
